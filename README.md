# Spain-Energy-Demand-Forecasting-
DF Project using Spain 2015-2018 Energy Generation, Consumption and Prices Data found in Kaggle
Weather data is not used however, can be implemented for further work.

In this project, we are able to perform multi-step forecasting with Deep Learning algorithms such as ANN and LSTM.

By multistep forecasting, using previous 14 days as an example, we can predict the next 7 days.

Since the error increases as we run on daily basis, hourly forecasting is preferable and gives more accurate results.

For further questions on the project, anyone can contact me from igorkemyeni@gmail.com
